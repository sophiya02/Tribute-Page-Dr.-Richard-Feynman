                <b>Richard Phillips Feynman</b> ForMemRS (/ˈfaɪnmən/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American
                theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the
                theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as
                well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For contributions to
                the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965
                jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.

                    <p>Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in Queens, New York City,[3] to Lucille née Phillips, a
                        homemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman, a sales manager[4] originally from Minsk in
                        Belarus[5] (then part of the Russian Empire). Feynman was a late talker, and did not speak
                        until after his third birthday. As an adult he spoke with a New York accent[6][7] strong
                        enough to be perceived as an affectation or exaggeration[8][9]—so much so that his friends
                        Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feynman spoke like a "bum".[8]</p>

                    <p>Feynman attended Far Rockaway High School, which was also attended by fellow Nobel laureates
                        Burton Richter and Baruch Samuel Blumberg.[20] Upon starting high school, Feynman was
                        quickly promoted to a higher math class. An IQ test administered in high school estimated
                        his IQ at 125—high but "merely respectable", according to biographer James Gleick.[21][22]
                        His sister Joan did better, allowing her to claim that she was smarter. Years later he
                        declined to join Mensa International, saying that his IQ was too low.[23</p>

                    <p>Feynman spent several weeks in Rio de Janeiro in July 1949.[113] That year, the Soviet Union
                        detonated its first atomic bomb, generating concerns about espionage.[114] Fuchs was
                        arrested as a Soviet spy in 1950 and the FBI questioned Bethe about Feynman's loyalty.[115]
                        Physicist David Bohm was arrested on December 4, 1950[116] and emigrated to Brazil in
                        October 1951.[117] Because of the fears of a nuclear war, a girlfriend told Feynman that he
                        should also consider moving to South America.[114] He had a sabbatical coming for
                        1951–52,[118] and elected to spend it in Brazil, where he gave courses at the Centro
                        Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas. In Brazil, Feynman was impressed with samba music, and
                        learned to play the frigideira,[119] a metal percussion instrument based on a frying pan
                        ("frigideira [pt].")[120] He was an enthusiastic amateur player of bongo and conga drums and
                        often played them in the pit orchestra in musicals.[121][122] He spent time in Rio with his
                        friend Bohm but Bohm could not convince Feynman to investigate Bohm's ideas on physics.[123]

                    <p>In the early 1960s, Feynman acceded to a request to "spruce up" the teaching of
                        undergraduates at Caltech. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of
                        lectures that later became The Feynman Lectures on Physics. He wanted a picture of a
                        drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book.
                        Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image,
                        the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing
                        drums in the foreword. The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists, Robert B.
                        Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years. Even though the books
                        were not adopted by universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they
                        provide a deep understanding of physics.[153] Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks
                        were turned into other books, including The Character of Physical Law, QED: The Strange
                        Theory of Light and Matter, Statistical Mechanics, Lectures on Gravitation, and the Feynman
                        Lectures on Computation.[154]</p>
